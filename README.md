### Introduction
The Rice Leaf Disease Classification Program is a machine learning project aimed at helping farmers and agricultural professionals identify and classify diseases in rice leaves using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This repository contains the source code, data, and documentation necessary to build and deploy the disease classification program.

### Features
1. Disease Classification: The program can classify rice leaf diseases into different categories, helping farmers take appropriate action to prevent or treat the diseases.
2. Easy-to-Use: Users can easily upload images of rice leaves, and the program will provide disease classification results.
3. Explainable AI (XAI): The latest update incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, making it easier for users to understand how the model makes predictions.
4. Federated Learning (FL): Federated Learning (FL) has been integrated to improve the model's performance and privacy by training on decentralized data sources.

### Usage
1. Access the web interface through your browser.
2. Upload an image of a rice leaf.
3. Classify And Get Solution
